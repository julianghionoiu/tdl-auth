                <h2>It is not just a coding exercise</h2>
                <p>You go through a realistic coding challenge designed to put your core software development skills to the
                    test.</p>
                <p>We promise that you will learn a lot by just going through this challenge.</p>

                <p>Focus on your development technique and see how well it plays out. You will be able to compare metrics
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>Each screen gets recorded so after the challenge you get the opportunity to see (anonymously) how other
                    people have approached this problem. You might be able to learn something from them.</p>
